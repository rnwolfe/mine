## Philosophy

**mine** is a developer CLI supercharger — a single Go binary that replaces the sprawl of productivity tools with one fast, delightful, opinionated companion.

- **Speed**: Every local command < 50ms. No spinners for local ops.
- **Single binary**: No runtime dependencies. `curl | sh` install.
- **Opinionated defaults**: Works out of the box. Escape hatches exist.
- **Local first**: Data stays on machine. Cloud features opt-in.
- **XDG-compliant**: `~/.config/mine/`, `~/.local/share/mine/`, `~/.cache/mine/`

## Example Usage

```bash
# Initialize
mine init

# Your personal dashboard
mine

# Add a task
mine todo add "ship v0.2" -p high -d tomorrow

# Start a focus session
mine dig 25m

# Bootstrap a Go project
mine craft dev go

# Configure mine from the terminal
mine config set user.name "Jane"
mine config set ai.provider openai
mine config list
```
